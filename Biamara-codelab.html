<div class="codelab-intro-container">
  <h1>Learn how to build a website</h1>
  <p>Have you ever wondered how all these big company's websites like <i><b>Google.com,</b></i> <i><b>Facebook.com,</b></i>
   <i><b>Youtube.com,</b></i> <i><b>Amazon.com,</b></i> and the rest of them were built? They obviously did not fall from the sky,
  someone sat down and built them with the same computer that you and I are using everyday. And these people happen to be among
  the world's richest billionairs today. You too can be among them, it's just a determination. In this tutorial, you are going to learn 
    how to build a website from scratch, it does not require you to have previous experience in programming, 
  but if you can read this to the end carefully, I assure you that you will then gain at least a basic knowledge
  in web development. However, it is not going to be as easy as reading A B C D, but it is 100 percent possible
  to become a perfect developer within six months, it only requires your attention and interest
  by making <i><b>coding</b></i> a hobby, that's all.<br><br> A functioning website is constructed with multiple
machine or code languages, but we will be using the three most
used languages, <span>HTML</span> <span>CSS</span> and 
<span>JavaScript</span> which you must learn in order to have their
basic knowledge as a beiginer before we move on to other laguages.</p>
<p class="p-intro"><span>HTML</span> This stands for "Hypertext Markup Language", 
this is used to build the srtucturer of web pages. It has elements, attributes,
tags, entities, etc. Think of HTML as the carpenter and the brick-layer who build a house 
from the foundation to the roofing level without any special design, no one can move in 
to that house like that.</p>
<p class="p-intro"><span>CSS</span> This stands for "Cascading Style Sheet", you are now
going to think of CSS as the tiler and the painter who design and beautify the
house. However, the house is not lively yet but one can still move in, in that current state.
Which simply means, after the work of CSS in the website, it could be published online and be visited
by users, just for reading blog posts.</p>
<p class="p-intro"><span>JavaScript</span> Finally, you can now think of JavaScript as the Plumber and Electrician
who make things happen in the house. A plumber connects every pipe to make sure that there is running water, the electrician does
his own job to make things function. JavaScript does the same thing in a website, it is a 
programming language that makes a website interactive.</p>
<p class="p-intro">Now that you have understood the role that <i><b>HTML</b></i>, <i><b>CSS</b></i>, and 
<i><b>JavaScript</b></i> play in web development, we are now going start, but before we begin, there are three tools that we will be working with. <button>The computer</button> 
  <button>The code editor</button> and <button>The browser</button>.</p>
  <img src="CodeImages/codeComputer.png" alt="Computer">
  <img src="CodeImages/editorBrowser.png" alt="Editor & Browser">
  <p>The code editor is where you will write your codes which will be installed on the computer, then, we use the browser to taste our work.
There are numerous code editors out there, but I would suggest you go for <i><b>Visual Studio Code (VS Code),</b></i>
for it is user friendly in programming, especially for beginners. Here is the link to download one, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code Editor.</a>
You can also download <i><b>Google Chrome Browser</b></i> here, <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome.</a> These are the tools
that I would recommend you to use as a new programmer.</p>
<p class="p-intro">Alright, now that we have all the required tools at our disposal, we can now start building our new website. Let's take these few steps first.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Create a folder on your computer, you can name it anything</li>
   <li>Inside the folder you've created, create a file with a HTML extension, example: <b>myfirstwebsite.html</b></li>
   <li>Create another file with a CSS extension, example: <b>myfirstwebsite.css</b></li>
   <li>Lastly, create another file with a JavaScript extension, example: <b>myfirstwebsite.js</b></li>
</ul>
   <p class="note-p">Feel free to use any word or name you like, what really matters is the extension, that is how the computer will understand which language it is before processing it.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open the code editor that you have downloaded, click on the icon <i><b>explorer,</b></i></li> from there you can open the folder you created, inside the folder 
  you will find all your files. open the <b>HTML,</b> that is where we are going to start from.
</ul>
</div>


<div class="codebox">

  <p><span class="note">NOTE:</span> You must structure your HTML code like the one shown here with these default codes before you proceed. 
  The default codes will show up immediately when you type <b>!</b> and press <i><b>enter. </b></i> 
link your CSS file inside the &lt;head&gt; tag the way it shows on my editor, mine is <b>Code-lesson.css,</b> you can see it there.</p>
<p>When you're building a website, the first thing you should build is the <button>Navigation bar</button>.
  So, let us build a navigation bar, using HTML and CSS.</p>

  <div class="htlm-code">
    <pre class="line-numbers">
     <code class="language-html">
       
     &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
     &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
       &lt;head&gt;
         &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
         &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge&quot;&gt;
         &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;
         &lt;title&gt;Code lessons&lt;/title&gt;
         &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;Code-lesson.css&quot;&gt;
       &lt;/head&gt;
       &lt;body&gt;
  
         &lt;!--Write your HTML codes here, within the 'body' tag--&gt; 

       &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
 
     </code> 
   </pre>
 </div>

 <p>We are now creating the navigation bar with four options, each option means a different web page. The rule of HTML is to always use 
  an <b>open</b> and a <b>close</b> tag like this: <b>&lt;opentag&gt; &lt;/closetag&gt;.</b> There numerous HTML tags, but later in this
  lesson you will learn some of them and their uses.
 </p>
 <p>You have noticed that we used a <b>nav</b> tag, that is the container in which the <b>h1</b> tag is written, we use 'h1' to write titles on websites.
 Inside the nav tag we also have a <b>ul</b> tag
which stands for <i><b>Under Lists,</b></i> in which we wrote the <b>li</b> tag, that is the lists of the menu options.
The <b>&lt;a href=" "&gt;</b> is the anchor or hyperlink tag that links to anonther page or website. within the double quote is where
website or page addresses are placed, I put <b>#</b> for now.</p>
<p>You have also noticed that inside the <b>nav</b> tag we have a class name <i><b>nav-bar.</b></i> written in this format <b>&lt;nav class="nav-bar"&gt;.</b>
The class name is what we are going to be using as a target when styling it with CSS, a well built website
must have many sections with different designs, therefore, a class name or Id name is what tells CSS exactly what to design. Feel free to use any name!</p>

 <div class="htlm-code" id="coder">
  <pre class="line-numbers">
   <code class="language-html">
     
   &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;nav class=&quot;nav-bar&quot;&gt;
       &lt;h1&gt;LOGO&lt;/h1&gt;
       &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;About us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Portfolio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt; 
   &lt;/body&gt;

   </code> 
 </pre>
</div>

<p>if you run this codes on your browser, this is what it will look like, we have structured
the <button>navigation bar</button> with HTML but it's not normal because we've not applied any design yet.
Now we are going to design it by targeting our class name <i><b>nav-bar</b></i> in CSS.</p>
<img src="CodeImages/navbar-1.jpg">
<hr>
<br>
<p>CSS normally uses a HTML class or Id name to design a particular section of the website.
  It uses a dot <b>'•'</b> in front of the class name like this: <b>.nav-bar</b> and uses <b>'#'</b> for Id name
like this: <b>#nav-bar,</b> then followed by open and close curly braces <b>{ }</b> in which you will write your codes.</p>

  <div class="css-code">
   <pre class="line-numbers">
     <code class="language-css">
     /*In this code, we targeted our class name 'nav-bar' with a dot infront of it,
             but we did not put anything infront of the the 'body' tag because
             it is neither a class nor Id, it is just a direct tag.*/
      
       
     body {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    
    .nav-bar {
      width: 100%;
      margin: 0;
    }
    
    .nav-bar > h1 {
      position: absolute;
      font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
      color: white;
      padding-left: 80px;
    }
    
    .nav-bar > ul {
      display: flex;
      margin: 0;
      width: 100%;
      height: 70px;
      justify-content: right;
      background-color: rgb(39, 112, 112);
    }
    
    .nav-bar > ul > li {
     list-style: none;
     line-height: 60px;
     font-size: 20px;
     padding: 0 10px;
     position: relative;
     right: 100px;
    }

     </code> 
   </pre>
</div>
<p>This is how our <button>Navigation bar</button> now looks after we have applied some CSS styles.
  The <b>body</b> is the body of the web page, in which everything on the page is placed. We used <b>'margin 0'</b>
  because we want our web page to have full-width, while <b>'padding 0'</b> tells it not to adjust any element within
  the page, unless we apply that directly from the element itself. The 'box-sizing' defines how the width and height
  of an element are calculated, therefore, the value <b>'border-box'</b> adds extra border and padding to the width and height
  of any box element that could be created.
</p>
<img class="navbar-img" src="CodeImages/navbar-2.jpg" alt="Navigation bar">
<p>Let us now change the hyperlinks color and remove the underlines. Attention please! whenever you see something like this
  <b>.nav-bar > ul > li > a { }</b>, it means that your main target here is the <b>a</b>
  tag, we are trying to tell CSS that the 'a' is inside the <b>li</b> tag, while the 'li'
  is inside the <b>ul</b> tag, and the 'ul' is the child of our main target <b>.nav-bar.</b>
  The reason is because there may be many <b>a</b> tags in different pages or sections of your website, if you don't tell CSS
  the exact target, it will style all the 'a' on your site, and you should know, this hyperlink 'a' also appears in the footer section
  of every website, which we will be creating next. Let's move on!
</p>
<div class="css-code">
  <pre class="line-numbers">
    <code class="language-css">
    /*We simply changed the link coror, font size, and apply a hover effect.*/

   
    .nav-bar > ul > li > a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: white;
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-size: 18px;
   }
   
   .nav-bar > ul > li > a:hover {
    color: yellow;
    transition: 0.4s;
   }

    </code> 
  </pre>
</div>
<!--<img class="navbar-img" src="CodeImages/navbar-3.jpg" alt="Navigation bar">-->
<video controls loop width="100%" autoplay>
  <source src="CodeImages/navvid-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>A <i><b>:hover</b></i> effect and the rest of them are known as <b>CSS pseudo classes,</b>
they are keywords added after a HTML class/Id name, or tags to specify a special state of that very
selector. Remember, tags, classes or Id names are also called 'selectors' in CSS, so, don't think of that
as something else. We added a 'hover' to our <b>a</b> tag/selector, and we applied yellow color to it
so that when someone hovers their mouse on the links, the action will take effect. The 'transition' is set
0.4seconds, it makes the hover effect not to act abruptly, but in a cool manner. Don't worry, you will learn
how these things works as we move on to the next step.</p>
<p>We have successfully created our <button>Navigation bar</button>, if you are reading this now
  it means that you have been following this tutorial step by step, so, I must congratulate you
  for haven learned how to build a navigation bar using HTML and CSS.</p>
